                <p>My name is Drew Barbee. I am from Winston-Salem, NC. I went to Clemson University to play soccer. I am currently
                    a Bar Manager at First Ward Beverage.
                </p>

                <p>I have a younger sister who is going back to school to get her Masters in Nursing so one day she can help
                    me when I get old and frail.
                </p>

                <p> I am looking for a new career path because working in customer service, retail, and sales suck.
